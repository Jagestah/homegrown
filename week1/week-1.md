### Workstation Setup

###### Installing a Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Recommendation for Mac: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com)
- Recommendation for Linux: [Terminal](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)

###### Creating a code folder
_Using your CLI_
1. Navigate to your `root` folder
  - `cd`
2. Create the `code` folder
  - `mkdir code`

###### Navigating the Command Line
_Refer to Additional-Resources.1 for a more complete list._

Quick callouts:
- `cd` = Change Directory, change the context of your CLI
  - `~` refers to your home directory
  - `cd` with no arguments takes you back to your home directory
  - `cd ~/code` takes you to your code repo
- `ls` = List, view the contents of your current CLI context(IE subdirectories and files)
  - `ll` is also a popular option

###### Installing an IDE
- Recommendation: [Atom](https://atom.io/)

###### Join the Code-Club-Crew (C3) Slack Workspace
In the Slack channel we have several Industry Professionals and students who can help when you get blocked or need additional clarification.

###  Intro to DevOps Methodology
###### What is DevOps?
There's differing opinions on what is or is not DevOps. There's also some ambiguity between DevOps as a culture and DevOps as a job function. In my experience, in companies where DevOps exists only as a culture the Developers are responsible for building the tooling and standards around deploying their team's application in an automated way. The skillset around this tooling is complimentary to a Developer's traditional skillset but is broad enough by itself to warrant an entirely new breed of Engineer. Enter the DevOps Engineer.

DevOps as a role is an evolution of a company adopting a DevOps Culture. At a certain point the operational overhead of maintaining the company's pipelines, tooling and the skillset surrounding those tasks becomes so great that it makes sense to hire someone solely for that function. One of the main advantages of having a DevOps Engineering role is their ability to specialize in CI/CD best practices, technologies, and standards that can be be applied organization wide, transcending teams.

###### Why DevOps for Companies?
Companies that have moved from adopting a DevOps culture to hiring dedicated DevOps Engineers is looking for a person or team of people to be force multipliers for their Developers.

These companies are usually feeling the pain of manual and very slow deployments, manual testing, and rampant human error.

###### Who makes a good DevOps Engineer?
I've found that people who are passionate about DevOps have some common personality features:
- Industriously Lazy
- Able to see the beauty in efficiency
- A fascination with automation

This list isn't exhaustive or exclusive.

### Intro to Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
###### What is IaC?
Infrastrucure as Code is a methodology that in its purest form would allow you to make any change necessary to the infrastructure via a change to source code. Thereby giving you access to all of the features of a source-controlled codebase. Such as; Versioned history and change control.

The idea that you could also leverage IaC to recover from any infrastructure failure or even spin up an exact replica of your infrastructure in a different geographical region or cloud provider is very lucrative to companies.

### Git
branches
repos
commits
pull
push
checkout
pull requests

### Weekly Homework:
Create a Github account
Create Repo for the ongoing project
Create a README.md in the repo documenting why the student is interested in the course
